## Goal

Create a simple backend application that provides an API for a dashboard which
allows a planner to get insights into client and planning information.

You will find the corresponding data that needs to be imported into the database
in `planning.json`, which contains around 10k records.

## Requirements

1. Create proper database tables that can fit the data model.
2. Create a script that imports the data into the database (sqlite).
3. Create REST APIs to get the planning data from the database.
    1. The APIs don't need to be complete, just create what you can in the
       available time.
    2. Please include at least one example on how to do each of the following:
        1. pagination
        2. sorting
        3. filtering / searching
